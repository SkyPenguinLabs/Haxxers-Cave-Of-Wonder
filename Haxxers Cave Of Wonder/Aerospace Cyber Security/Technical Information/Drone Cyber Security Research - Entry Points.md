#### Aerospace Security: Entry Points - Introduction To Module 

In this module we will be going over how drones work internally, discuss military vs civilian drones and also go over some more technical sides of them whilst going over attack surfaces. So, something I would like to state before getting into this is going back to the first module - drones are fluid and very diverse. Depending on the type of drone, you may find specific drones with unique or proprietary modules or systems in use and the primary purpose or aim of this section is to point out THE MOST COMMON entry points which an attacker may want to target. So, do not be surprised if this section fails to be the godly best fucking resource in the world for picking apart a drone- deal with it XD.

Now, before we start this module, I would like to get down an idea or general layout of these sections which will go from super technical to kinda technical to super technical again. Prepare for a world of interest.

* **Entry Points: Why Care** -> This section aims to point out why a hacker even cares about the physical aspects of a drone or system. Given that this module kind of takes ideas from the automotive security section, we will also be explaining in comparison as to why a hacker may want access to a physical system period.

* **Entry Points: Civilian Vs Military** -> Note that I have absolutely 0 experience in the military realm, for fuck sakes I am 16- what else do you expect. But, I would like to discuss some primary differences which have been discussed with ex-military members who spent time in aerospace related fields in the military which is not just from the U.S but also from other countries such as Russia.

* **Entry Points: John fucking Cena** -> In this section, we will literally be taking a drone, and smashing it to dissect its internal pieces. Woah woah woah- I am not even close to having the money to doing that but we will definitely be taking apart a drone and using other deconstruction demonstrations to explain specific parts of the drone and what the drone entails!

* **Entry Points: Communications** -> In addition to the previous section, I would like to go a bit more over serial communications used within drones and elaborate on physical attacks and why they may not be so prominent in this field.

Now that we have laid out a general idea of what we can or would want to go over, we can now get into the module! 

> Note: This module is going to be placed a bit wacky. As you know, by now I am not giving a singular fuck what regulation I have to follow for "academic practice". I am writing this the way I am because I simply do not care- I am here to talk about the systems not try my best to follow some rule set by someone I have never met |insert skull emoji| meant to control words-

#### Aerospace Security: Entry Points - Why Care 

This is where the world starts to flip. So you may be asking yourself as you most likely did in the vehicle security section- why care about the physical access? This is also where the reverse engineering aspects come into play. When you are taking a drone and want to understand how it works without some weird ass manual in front of you, you will eventually need to dig deeper into the physical properties of the drone. Or, heck, maybe you may need to commit some nifty FI ( Fault Injection ) to make sure you are getting the good hands of the systems internals and maybe bypassing security mechanisms to snatch that firmware! Well, all of this requires some form of physical knowledge. Not to mention, having a deep physical understanding of the system you are digitally dissecting is important to when trying to mess with communications as being able to dissect and understand specific modules the drone may be using may allow you to pose as a much more unique and greater threat to the drone itself! Speaking of modules, some drones outside of your everyday DJI drone will most likely be using some form of third party communications module which means by just your nifty luck- you may be able to find a vulnerability on that module within that drone especially if you can purchase the module from the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer). Something I made note of in the automotive security series was that the realm of physical attacks especially when it comes to serial communication attacks such as CAN injection, it is very rare that an attacker will go that far to physically attack a machine simply because it takes so much time and effort and proper materials even down to an insane amount of practice. While the research is good and general physical attacks even as much as fault injection or invasive fault injection are a great point for conducting research- they are extremely hard to replicate and can take a ton of embedded knowledge which may not be what the original user wants to do with the drone. Sometimes, as mentioned above, it can be worth it and fault injection attacks as well as other various attacks on hardware or serial communications but generally speaking - it is not a high focus.

#### Aerospace Security: Entry Points -  Civilian Vs Military

Now we reach into a different section- when it comes to the entry points of a drone, how will the military sector differ from the civilian sector. Well, common sense would tell you that a 1 million dollar drone would have much more technical equipment such as protocols, tracing and range tech and a million different systems compare dot your average $300 off the shelf drone. Of course, the primary difference between the two can be broken down into 10 primary points which have been horribly listed below.

* **Purpose and Use Cases** -> Obviously one is used to completely annihilate buildings and people while others are used for general photography and videoography. But there is of course, a much more technical and in depth answer than that. Generally speaking, militarized drones have much more unique systems and technologies in them that allow them for much more unique video and photo taking, not to mention they have a much more longer range of distance in both camera and general communications which allows them to have a more designated purpose and accurate set of eyes if you will. As you can imagine, civilian drones are not used to spot people miles and miles away using thermal technologies, instead these drones are used for more general use cases such as mapping, agriculture, environmental monitoring, and more. 

* **Payload (Physical)**  -> Another primary difference between militarized drones and general civilian drones is the payload size and weight they can carry. Do not get me wrong, there are some amazing high dollar civilian drones out there that can carry a ton of weight and payloads, but militarized drones are way more larger in size- I mean ZenaDrone seems to have a good head on their shoulders when they state that "**A fighter drone is often larger and heavier than a commercial drone, weighing over 600 kilograms (roughly 1,300 pounds)**. Comparatively, retail and consumer drones weigh up to 20 kilograms (about 40 pounds)." The payload weight and use case also matters as well and differs- civilians should not be hoisting up 500 pounds worth of explosives but UAV operationalists may need to do so due to specific combat related tasks.  

* **Weaponization** -> We kind of already went over this, but standard military drones are going to be equipped with much more high tech weaponized equipment which may be used to either attack general infrastructure or will be used to target other structures. Your everyday DJI drone is not meant to carry or be weaponized- despite some morons doing so by placing a fire arm or some fireworks on the drone inside of a release mechanism- fucking idiots LMAO.

* **Communications** -> We have hit by far my most favorite part during this dicussion. When it comes to the world of militarized drones and general technologies even as much as vehicles in the military sector- you notice that the communication standards will change and the protocols and systems used are much more intense and so expensive and so well hidden from the general public that even the most sophisticated general development agencies could not get their hands on it! The primary reason being is- obviously due to the factor that you should not be weaponizing a one million dollar drone with a bunch of massive fucking missiles and shit and then just using the most basic serial communication protocol or even the most basic radio transmission system. Well, I take that back because apparently some countries just LIKE being completely fucking different as the cxase is with Ukrain currently using A FUCKING CARDBOARD BOX to attack millions of dollars worth of airspace equipment as shown below.

* **Long Term Surveillance** -> Unlike traditional drones, militarized drones are not only equipped to travel faster and for longer distances but are also equipped to stay in the air MUCH more longer before a genuine refuel. It was noted in a military research paper and publication that typical drones can last up to 16+ hours in the air without any form of refuel or regathering. As you can imagine, given the weight of the payload, factor in all the fancy tech and what not, obviously a militarized drone might have much more unique underlying factors that make it much more specialized for heavier tasks.

* **Frequencies** -> Traditional drones use very specific and publicly known frequencies such as the 802.11 bands which are used for controlling the drone and can even be used for video frequencies. However, you may also spot standard Bluetooth communications and ISM bands! All of these different frequencies differ in performance, range and etc. But what about military drones? These drones operate off of specific bands, more unique and powerful bands that need to be able to interact with other aerospace systems such as the very thousands of satellites in the endless fuck boy void of nothingness- space. I will not speak too too much on this, but these systems that are implemented on specific UAVs are bound to give off quite the amount of radiation due to the KU-bands and C-band frequencies that are used. These type of bands are quite powerful, but as you can imagine, they are needed so that militarized UAVs can properly reach and communicate with other aerospace related systems.

But how does knowing this affect your research? Well, it really does not effect much of your research and should not- but the primary issue is whether or not you are willing to go farther than just standard drones and at least understanding how more advanced and private systems work is important! Now, of course, no person unless contracted to do so or no person without government adjacent contacts could get access to even a simulator that can mock a militarized UAV- but at the same time, maybe its worth a try and definitely worth the knowledge. The information here should at least give you an idea of what is in store for civilian UAVs and what you may commonly spot.

#### Aerospace Security: Entry Points -  John Fucking Cena

Alright, so, we are passed all the intermediate bullshit, now what? Now, its time for us to John Cena a fucking drone! WOOOOO HELL YEAH! So lets get into it. Alright, so this section will focus on pointing out some primary points within a standard civilian drone. The reason we want to pick up just civilian drones is because again I have absolutely 0 experience with military technologies and plus do not expect anyone to have access to one- So anyway, below are two images, a GIF of John Cena tackling someone from the air and then a drone which we will be going over.

![[john-cena-gif.gif]]

Now we can go over the drone- so lets get a good image and idea down for what lies within a drone!

![[Mavic_Mini_Teardown_1.jpg]]

Tear-down operations are exactly that, they are operations where nearly every single part of the drone or said object is disassembled and well organized. There are many reasons why a hacker may want to do this, or maybe why an attacker may want to do this. Lets go back to the automotive security series I did a while back. When working with automotive or vehicular exploitation, there are many reasons a hacker may want to do that even down to physical attacks. However, one primary reason stands out - modification. Ever since devices have existed in this world, from Microsoft to Apple, devices have been securely locked down to prevent modification and systems like Linux proved why allowing user modification can be very important. You may frequently see military members also use drones like an older version of a DJI drone for multiple reasons, because during these tear-down operations, they can easily reverse engineer the physical aspects of the drone itself and modify specific units, add hardware or even modify specific systems such as the GPS on the drone if they can locate it or find it- or if its even a module that exists within the drone. So here is where things get a bit weird, if physical tear-downs along with physical attacks such as serial communication injection, fault injection (&Invasive) are all really time consuming, why would someone go this far? Well, in the case of say communication injection ( this falls for anything like CAN injection or other forms of protocol based injection attacks ) its not super helpful to someone that wants to modify a drone unless they need to make an emergency controller- even then, there may be other and much more better alternatives for that. That being said, when it comes to tear-downs, someone might want to modify the units of their own drone to disable specific mechanisms, or maybe say a agent is using a drone to spy on someone and they want to disable a speed Governor. This actually is a very good demonstration of general vehicles. For example, your standard   
**Talaria Sting MX3** includes a state of the art speed Governor, and having that system can actually halt a ton of functionality and performance from the bike ( theoretically )- so fuck that shit, we do not need it- so we snip it. The same falls for drones, if we do not want GPS tracking then we can go in digitally, reverse engineer the software and disable the GPS similar to other systems on the drone. Tear-downs are important not just because of the physical modification but because they give hackers much more unique insight about the drone itself and can also give you a good road-map of where to go! Now, shut the fuck up haxxer- lets get down to the physical aspects of the drone as that is what we are here to discuss- fuckin hell.

Below I have listed a few primary modules and systems that exist within a drone or UAV that is standard to civilians and is unmodified. This will kind of follow the image below which is a DJI Mavic Mini Tear-down but do note that these are all general parts of a drone and are going to be found in a typical drone. I also would like to note that the parts listed here are sometimes going to include why an attacker might want to target them.  

* **Frame** -> There are some drones that do not have a frame but its still kind of weird to say a drone does not have a frame- anyway, each drone for the most part has some form of frame to help hold all of the electronics and systems together. You may notice that every drone has its own unique frame build, well this is because frames are typically designed per a specific requirement or need. For example, if a drone is carrying heavy equipment and needs to operate in specific whether conditions then you would see a more box like frame and vice versa for something that needs to be fast and lightweight- it would be aerodynamic instead. 

* **Controller** -> Every drone has some form of flight controller or set of controllers which is designed for specific needs on the system. Each controller or unit such as the Flight Controller is a unique processing unit. Using the Flight Controller as an example- this is a unique central processing unit that manages the drones dynamics and flight systems such as the positioning of the drone and stabilization  

* **ESCs** -> A ESC also known as an Electronic Speed Controller is a type of device that is used to regulate the speed of the drones motors and propellers which is also fed commands from the flight controller module. You know that from the vehicle security series that vehicles have ECUs ( Electrical Control Units ) for specific systems such as the transmission such as the TCU is ( Transmission Control Unit ). Well the TCU accepts commands to help with the general transmission system of the vehicle. In drones, an ESC will do something similar as its taking commands from another processing unit and electrical module that can help it coordinate for more unique flight engagement! 

* **MCUs** -> Similar to ESCs, drones also have a version of these for micro-controllers known as a micro-controller Unit which is a specific smaller electrical unit or module within the drone that is used to manage very specific tasks such as network communication and processing of data. Think of these as a smaller ESC.

* **Unique Receivers** -> From a secondary note, I had an individual section describing specific receivers within the vehicle, but this is something I would have loved to go deeper into- sadly that is out of scope of this module ( for now ). Anyway, receivers are also another common thing that you find within drones that also have their own unique tasks- for example, the GPS Receiver. This receiver is responsible for gathering information about the current precise location by capturing unique signals from GPS satellites! Now are you starting to see why specific UAVs especially militarized UAVs may need more aerospace control :>? 

* **Specific Ports / Access Ports** -> Like every computer in this world no matter the shape or form of the computer, ports exist on drones. These ports can also have their own unique use cases and also have their own unique adapters that would be put into place. For example, the data port is a port on the drone that with proper access will allow for firmware updates, specific data transfers and even in the slightest cases where protection is not implemented external device connections. Slots like the micro SD card slot will also be used in the case of data exporting such as photos or videos that were shot with the drone. 

* **Other Systems** -> I decided to put the next following list under other systems due to them not being so- under obvious. Each drone will typically include a camera and a gimbal which is a stabilization system and part for more advanced camera soothing and smoothing. Drones will also include Radio transceivers which are there to set a two-way communication system that can allow direct connection between the drone and the remote which is extended with antennas ( transmission and Receiving ). They may also come with unique flight lights to help indicate a specific status of the drone- for example some drones have a mechanism to flash specific light color patterns to indicate auto pilot or dangerous conditions or maybe even a lower battery. Most drones also come with some sort of telemetry system which provides the drone and the user with real-time data such as the drones battery level, altitude, and distance from the transmitter! 

Now that we know some basic understandings of what a drone may have internally, lets talk about why a hacker may want to target this. I remember noting that I will include those points about how a hacker or why a hacker wants to target said system but I figured later on I would just end up throwing this into its own section. So, the next few points are going to be directed to re state the points above but explain why a hacker might want to target those systems. Now, some points will also not be stated due to the factor that Its just an obvious point of entry. 

* **Control Units** -> When a hacker reverse engineers a drone, they may want to target specific control units on the drone that may be used for flight! There are many reasons they may want to do this such as wanting to modify specific functions within the drones system or maybe to even add some new plugins to the drone even if it does not particularly allow users to plugin their own systems or modules! This may come in handy in warfare especially when a hacker needs to mess up the networking processes or even intercept them!

* **Flight & Network Controllers** -> These type of controllers are going to be the most targeted system amongst all drone systems primarily because messing and customizing your own controllers and communication systems are quite important when you want to go through with further modification of the drone. A hacker may also want to get inside of these modules because of the information they hold which can be more used for further reverse engineering! 

* **Physical Access** -> This entire section is about the physical details of a drone, but the systems are at most point vulnerable to some extent no matter how much a manufacturer would like to protect it. Physical access is typically gathered through the ports of the drone or the system which is anything from simple SD slots to complex and standard USB 3.0 ports! This physical access can allow hackers to investigate more on the direct side of things when it comes to ports and other things like that! 

There are other systems but I can imagine that you already have a good idea of other systems that a hacker may target. Mostly, hacking drones and attacking specific parts of the drone can be separated into a few primary sectors but most rely around communication disruption, or modification of the drone itself and the modules within it!
