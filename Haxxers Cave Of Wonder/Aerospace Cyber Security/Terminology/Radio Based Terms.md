##### SDR ( Software Defined Radio )

> A SDR is a radio communication system where traditional hardware components that are on your everyday radios are augmented with software. SDRs actually allow for much more unique adaptability and flexibility during radio signalling. 

##### Frequency Hopping 

> This is a technique where the transmitting radio frequency changes rapidly accorsing to a unique specific pattern. This is actually a security technique as it makes it quite difficult for attackers to intercept or jam the signal.

##### Modulation

> This is the process of varying a carriers signal properties to encode information like changing the frequency (FM), amplitude (AM), or phase (PM)

##### Demodulation

> As you can imagine, this is the complete opposite of modulation where this is the process of extracting the original information from a modulated signal.

##### AM (Amplitude Modulation)

> This is a modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to transmit the given information.

##### FM (Frequency Modulation)

>  Modulation technique where the frequency of the carrier signal is varied to transmit information.

##### PM (Phase Modulation)

> Modulation technique where the phase of the carrier signal is varied to transmit information.

##### Spread Spectrum 

> Method of transmitting a signal over a frequency band much wider than the data rate, improving signal reliability and security.

#### RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification )

> Technology that uses radio waves to identify and track objects.

##### NFC (Near Field Communication)

> Short-range wireless communication technology used for data exchange between devices.

##### SNR (Signal To Noise Ratio)

> Ratio of the strength of a desired signal to the strength of background noise.
