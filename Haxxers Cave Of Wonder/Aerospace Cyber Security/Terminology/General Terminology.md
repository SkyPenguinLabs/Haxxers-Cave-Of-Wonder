##### UAV 

> Unmanned Aerial Vehicle which can also be known as a UAS or Unmanned Aerial System. These are commonly known as drones.
##### FCS

> Flight Control System is a system that can manage and control a given aircraft's flight 
##### SatCom

> Also known as satellite communication, this is the communication systems that use satellites for data transmission 
##### ICBM 

> The Intercontinental Ballistic Missile is a long-range missile designed for nuclear payload delivery
##### Avionics 

> Electronic systems that are used within aviation which can include communication and navigation systems.
##### ASCS 

> Also known as Aviation Safety Critical Systems is a system who's failure can lead to catastrophic consequences which is designed to lose less than one life per billion (10^9) hours of operation
##### ATMS

> Also known as an Air Traffic Management System is a specific infrastructure for managing air traffic flow. 
##### RPASS

> This infra is known as the Remote Piloted Aircraft System Security which ensures the security of remotely controlled aircraft's. 
##### SCADAS

> Also known as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems is a control system for critical infrastructure. 
##### FDR 

> Similar to a vehicles EDR, a FDR is known as a Flight Data Recorder and is used to record flight data for post incident analysis. Again, in the same way an Event Data Recorder inside of a vehicle will record drive and general network information when a specific event happens.
##### ADBs

> This is a shorter way of saying Aircraft Data Buses and Communication Bus is an even simpler way of saying Aircraft Data Buses. These are just the communication networks connecting avionic systems. 

##### ACIRT 

> This is a unique team known as Aircraft Cyber Incident Response Team which is a team that is dedicated to responding towards cyber security incidents within aviation.

##### ASAD

> Also known as Avionics System Anomaly Detection is the process of identifying abnormal behavior in avionic systems. 
##### UTM

> Unmanned Traffic Management is a system for managing drone traffic in shared airspace
##### SCIF

> Sensitive Compartment Information Facility is a secure facility for handling classified information. 
##### ATN 

> Aeronautical Telecommunication Network also known as an ATN is a network for aviation communications and informational exchanges. 
##### AHMS 

> The Aircraft Health Monitoring System is a system that monitors an aircraft's health and transmit data for maintenance analysis.
