##### Common Dangers and Points 

There are several challenges to performing high-quality TARAs (Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment) as referenced in **ISO 21434** "Road vehicles - Cybersecurity engineering" standard. Some of these challenges include:

1. Lack of expertise: Cybersecurity is a complex and rapidly evolving field, and it can be challenging for organizations to have the necessary knowledge to perform a TARA.
    
2. Identifying all potential threats: As cyber threats are constantly evolving, it can be challenging to identify all potential threats to the vehicle's systems, components, and functions.
    
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls and measures: It can be challenging to determine the effectiveness of cybersecurity controls and measures, particularly when new and emerging technologies are involved.
    
4. Assessing the likelihood and impact of identified cybersecurity risks: It can be challenging to accurately evaluate them, particularly when new and emerging technologies are involved.
    
5. Identifying all relevant stakeholders: It can be challenging to identify all relevant stakeholders, such as vehicle manufacturers, suppliers, and regulatory authorities, and to communicate the results of the TARA process to them.
    
6. Ensuring ongoing monitoring and maintenance: It can be challenging to continuously monitor and maintain the vehicle's cybersecurity controls and measures, particularly when new and emerging technologies are involved.
    
7. Complying with regulations and standards: It can be challenging to comply with them, such as ISO 21434, which is constantly evolving and changing.
    
8. Finding the right balance between security and functionality: It can be challenging to find the right balance between security and functionality, particularly when new and emerging technologies are involved.
    
9. Making the right risk treatment decision on avoiding, reducing, transferring, or sharing the risk.
